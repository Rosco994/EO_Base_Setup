# Arena spawn information
#
# Format:
#  id.enabled = (yes|no)
#  id.time = time
#  id.block = block
#  id.spawns = {src_x,src_y, target_x,target_y)
#
# Example:
#  10.enabled = yes
#  10.time = 30
#  10.block = 3
#  10.spawns = 11,9, 7,11, 11,6, 4,4
#
# Creates an arena on map 10 that spawns every 30 seconds.
# There are 2 spawns (at 11,9 and 11,6) that warp to 7,11 and 4,4 respectively.
# If there are more than 3 people in the arena, new entrants will be delayed.
#
# PK is automatically disabled on maps with arena enabled.
#
# It is recommended to create a new file and change the config to point at it
# rather than editing this file.
